# Shotcut (WIP)

Shotcut is a simple URL shortner. It's main code is less than 50 lines, and I want to keep 
the backend very simple and minimaslistic.


## Features
- It is very simple to use.
- You don't need to create an account.
- You can create unlimited shortened URLs.
- The URL you created won't be deleted.
- You can choose your own slug.
- Deleting the URL is requires password for each URL individually.


## Try it yourself!

You can try it yourself by visiting [sc.samrid.me](https://sc.samrid.me/docs).


## Warning

- Before using it please be known that this project is a WIP (Work In Progress), and I might
dump the database until I properly release v1 of the project. 
- The API may also change in the upcoming days so don't use it for anything permanent.
